This Site is designed to speed up and simplify the process of providing Locums and other medical staff to hospitals. This site has intelligent 
code which immediately contacts the right users (Locums/ medical staff) when a shift is requested by a hospital. 
Delays are also caused by waiting for human choices or actions such as replying to emails, texts, WhatsApp etc.
  The Site aims to reduce that by working with live data only.

<div class="panel-body">
Unless you enjoy reading piles of outdated agency emails, or going through WhatsApp, this Site is designed to eliminate all of that. The Live Job Offers
are just that, still live, and what's more, they have been directed at you personally. This means a great reduction in the amount of time it takes for you
to find the right job, and also to get a response. Reading and accepting or rejecting jobs is simple also. <br>
Go to the Live Job Offers, and view each job. Accepting or Rejecting each job clears up your list quickly and simply.

Simply assign yourself to the Job. The site will do the rest. It will update both the hospital and the Agency. It will also no longer send
out the job to any other user whom may have been assigned the same shift. Note also, if you were sent another job for the same day, then that will be automatically
cancelled as well. <mark>You will be expected to turn up at any shift that you have assigned yourself too.</mark>

The site is doing that for all users. This is to ensure an even distribution of jobs amongst all the right users. It is also to prevent users from 
sitting on lots of jobs when they could be sent to others. However, this will also cut down on the amount of "job clutter" that you have to go through.
 If you reject one job on a particular day, the site may decide to send you another job for the same day.

	<li>Be patient. Jobs offers do come through. Be sure to check this site when you get a chance!</li>
	<li>Have you checked the self admin section to ensure you are linked with the right hospitals?</li>
	<li>Job Offers are live. If someone else assigns themself first, then that job is then no longer sent to you.</li>
	<li>Are you an infrequent User? Over time, this site is coded to favour the most frequent users first for jobs.</li>
