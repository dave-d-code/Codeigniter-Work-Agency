This Site is designed to speed up and simplify the process of providing Locums and other medical staff to hospitals. This site has intelligent 
code which immediately contacts the right users (Locums/ medical staff) when a shift is requested by a hospital. Delays are also caused by waiting for human choices or actions such as replying to emails, texts, WhatsApp etc.
  The Site aims to reduce that by working with live data only.

The site reads the form and automatically selects the right users for you based on a criteria list. This includes having the right skills,
 being able to work at your hospital, and are likely to be available. This means that your request gets to the right people quickly with no delay.
 This site also instantly tells you how many users were selected. (Normally 5 candidates for every job).

<div class="panel-body">
There can be instances when the site searches for users meeting your criteria, and simply cannot find any! This is
normally because those listed are not available or do not successfully meet the requirements. However, the site will then highlight your form and
flag it up to the Agency for their personal attention.
