What is ACME AGENCY about?

This Site is designed to speed up and simplify the process of providing Locums and other medical staff to hospitals. This site has intelligent 
code which immediately contacts the right users (Locums/ medical staff) when a shift is requested by a hospital.
 Delays are also caused by waiting for human choices or actions such as replying to emails, texts, WhatsApp etc.
  The Site aims to reduce that by working with live data only.

How long does it take to read a client request, and then reforward that information out to the locums?? And then wait for a reply?? And then update the
clients?? This Site can handle all the routine job requests in fractions of a second, without making any mistakes. This leaves you free to worry about other tasks
like more troublesome bookings or locum admin. You will get to see the bookings as they come in, and see if they get assigned or not.

Absolutely. You have an overview of what is happening all the time with the bookings. This Site is designed to vastly reduce the workload by handling 
normal bookings, and improving communications between you, the locums, and the clients. Again, this leaves you free to worry about the important stuff.
Once a user assigns or rejects a job, you are updated accordingly. The hospital is also updated when the job is assigned. The site also knows what other jobs
a user has for the day, and cancels him from them as well. 
The site makes job management much more easier.

The booking tables say that they self update. What does that mean?

</h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFive">
<div class="panel-body">
Instead of logging in and out all the time, or navigating around the site to see whats new, you can leave yourself logged on to any of the 
bookings tables. If left untouched, the site tells your computer to check in every 5 minutes to see if there are any updates. If there are,
you will be notified in that time period.

How does the Site pick which Users are getting each Job?
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingSix">
<div class="panel-body">
The Site decides which user is selected based on
<ul>
	<li>Having the right skill set</li>
	<li>Not already engaged in another shift on that day</li>
	<li>Linked (works) at the Hospital</li>
	<li>Had no more than 2 job proposals for that day already</li>
</ul>
The Site has also code that will begin to favour the users whom routinely take jobs instead of those whom infrequently take jobs.
